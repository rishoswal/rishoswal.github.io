Welcome to my website! I'm glad you're here.

I'm an undergrad at the University of Washington studying CS and potentially also Applied Math and Economics to make it a triple major! Although, I'm still explore other options such as CFRM at the moment as well. I also have a strong passion for entrepreneurship.

I want to be building products at the forefront of AI, but something different than the thousands of ChatGPT wrapper startups that have come up in the past few years. Currently, my focus is on using AI and AR for accessibility for vision impairments. I want to develop the next generation of AR technology for vision impairment - specifically, an all-in-one wearable that will ultimately replace the need for human VA/PAs with advanced context-aware AI assistance. 

More complex queries like: ````"Guide me through this game of poker"````, ````"Help me find my medication in the cabinet"````, ````"Monitor me and alert me as I cook my lunch for today"```` should be a reality soon, and I want to be the one to build it.

This website is hopefully going to be a way for me to organize my thoughts publicly.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
