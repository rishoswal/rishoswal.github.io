Humane released it's infamous AI "pin" a while ago, known widely in part to the MKBHD review describing it as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA&t=932s">worst product he's ever reviewed</a>. But I believe that Humane missed their target audience - those with vision impairments. The idea of having an assistive pin equipped with context-aware AI could've revolutionized how those with vision impairments interact with their environments.

There are already enough reviews about why this device is terrible (price point, tacky tech, etc). But, they have ventured into the right direction:
- Context-aware AI assistance by scanning the environment
- Customization of AI assistance over time
- Language translation
- CosmOS (although very slow) is great at condensing lots of AI models to create a very smooth and multimodal experience

Ultimately, this just needs a few more things to become a viable device for low/no-vision users:
- Faster OS
- Obstacle detection and navigation
- Facial recognition

Can this pin replace a phone? Is it worth it's price point? 

Definitely not. But, I believe that the idea of the device is very promising and can ultimately replace human personal assistants for those who need it.
